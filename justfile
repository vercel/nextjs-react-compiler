# This repo vendors the React Compiler (Rust port) from react/react main
# into ./react-compiler, then (editing only Cargo.toml for crate naming) sets each
# crate's published name to `nextjs_react_compiler_*` while keeping the lib/import
# name, source, and directories as upstream's `react_compiler_*`, and adds the
# metadata + `publish` flags to release `nextjs_react_compiler` and its deps to crates.io.
#
# The oxc-project org ruleset forbids merge commits, so the vendor is a linear
# snapshot (not `git subtree`): each `sync` re-extracts upstream's `compiler/`,
# re-runs the transform tool (./codemod), re-applies ./patches, and commits once.
# Both are re-applied every sync because the snapshot is taken fresh.
#
#   just import       # one-time: create ./react-compiler (transformed)
#   just sync         # update ./react-compiler to the latest main state (re-transformed)
#   just codemod      # (re)run codemod on ./react-compiler in place
#   just patch        # apply ./patches/*.patch (Rust source changes the codemod can't express)
#   just check        # cargo check the vendored workspace
#   just publish-dry  # dry-run publishing the whole set (cargo publish --workspace --dry-run)
#   just publish      # publish nextjs_react_compiler + its deps via cargo-release-oxc
#   just status       # show which upstream commit is currently vendored
